-platforms with empty space on both sides, not too many--grappler, not platformer
-i dont want to design a bunch of levels.  i want to design mechanics.  keep it small.
-the game should be about combos and moving about the space.  landing = losing combos
    -this naturally means enemies should respawn, but they need some sort of system

-no ceiling, thats boring.

-enemies can just have spawners that spawn them in on a timer after they die, doesnt need to be clever
-can kill enemies by jumping on head, grapple-stomping, or picking up and throwing
-can have like just three areas with scores / max combos associated with each

enemies:
-slime, moves back and forth on platforms
-fish, jumps out of water
-birds, move diagonally, moves in lines, bounces off walls

elements:
